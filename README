------------------||Gather v0.3||-------------------
Gather is a web based survey server.
It allows for the creation, distribution, and
data collection of surveys. The goal of the 
project is to keep users in control of their
research data, host their own server, do whatever 
they want with the back end data and customize Gather 
exactly to their needs.
----------------------------------------------------


Gather is using rails v3.1.0 and has been tested with
mysql and ruby 1.8.7.

A demo of the latest version will always be around to 
play with. Trying to break it is essential, as long as
you report bugs found.
